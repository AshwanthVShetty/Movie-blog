        <h2>Story Line</h2>
        <p class="storyline">The defense and the prosecution have rested, and the jury is filing into the jury room to decide if a young man is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. What begins as an open-and-shut case of murder soon becomes a detective story that presents a succession of clues creating doubt, and a mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and preconceptions about the trial, the accused, AND each other. Based on the play, all of the action takes place on the stage of the jury room.</p>
        <table>

        <p class="plot">Following the Perrons' blood-curdling encounter with the supernatural described in The Conjuring (2013), and the Lutzes' controversial case of possession portrayed in The Amityville Horror (1979), the seasoned explorers of the unexplained, Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren, reluctantly agree to investigate the Hodgsons' strange case of paranormal disturbance in 1977 Enfield, London. Referred by the local media as England's Amityville, the Warrens meet the working-class single mother, Peggy Hodgson, who, along with her four children, find themselves being terrorised by what can only be described as intense poltergeist activity. Once more, innocence attracts the blackest of evil, and Peggy's utterly unprotected eleven-year-old daughter, Janet, already shows puzzling signs of change in her character. However, is the peculiar Enfield case, indeed, a genuine haunting, or an elaborate hoax?</p>
